# Project Portfolio

This repository contains multiple projects demonstrating various techniques and models in the fields of computer vision, API integration, regression analysis, and data processing. Below is a brief overview of each project:

## 1. Computer Vision

This folder contains two key projects exploring fundamental and advanced concepts in computer vision:

- **[ImagePyramids](Computer_Vision/ImagePyramids.ipynb)**: This notebook demonstrates the use of image pyramids for image processing, such as down-sampling and up-sampling images to create multi-scale representations, which is useful in object detection and other image analysis tasks.

- **[Lane Detection Project](Computer_Vision/Lane_Detection_Project.ipynb)**: This project focuses on detecting road lanes from images or video frames. It employs edge detection, region of interest selection, and Hough transform to identify lanes, a common task in autonomous driving applications.

## 2. HDFS_Spark

This [folder](HDFS_Spark) includes a project related to working with Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and Apache Spark, which are essential tools for handling large-scale data processing and distributed computing tasks.

## 3. IMDB_API_Project

This project involves fetching and processing movie data using the IMDb API. The project structure includes:

- **[imdb_code.py](IMDB_API_project/imdb_code.py)**: Python script to interact with the IMDb API, is fetching data such as movie titles, ratings, genres, etc.
- **[imdb_helper_functions.py](IMDB_API_project/imdb_helper_functions.py)**: This script contains helper functions for managing API requests, data processing, and cleaning tasks.
- **[imdb_report.ipynb](IMDB_API_project/imdb_report.ipynb)**: A Jupyter notebook that presents analysis, visualization, and insights derived from the IMDb data fetched via the API.
- **[IMDB_API_project.md](IMDB_API_project/IMDB_API_project.md)**: Documentation explaining the project and its goals.

## 4. IMDB Regression

This project focuses on predicting IMDb movie ratings or other numerical data using machine learning regression models. The folder contains:

- **[IMDb movies.csv](IMDB_regression/IMDb_movies.csv)**: A dataset containing various attributes of movies such as title, genre, rating, runtime, and other features used for training the regression model.
- **[project_ml_regression_IMDB.ipynb](IMDB_regression/project_ml_regression_IMDB.ipynb)**: A notebook that implements machine learning regression algorithms to predict IMDb movie ratings or other continuous variables. The workflow involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation.

## 5. Census Income

This [folder](census_income) contains a project related to predicting income levels or classifications using the well-known "Census Income Dataset." Project involves tasks such as binary classification (predicting whether a person earns more than $50k per year), feature engineering, and model evaluation.
